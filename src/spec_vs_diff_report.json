  "summary": "Implemented a reusable LinkifiedText component that auto-links URLs with target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noreferrer noopener\", and integrated it into PostCard captions. However, the diff evidence only shows the change applied in PostCard; there is no clear evidence it is applied in other places where post descriptions may be displayed (e.g., post detail view). Also includes unrelated changes (project_state.json and modifications to useInternetIdentity.ts) not requested by the BuildRequest.",
